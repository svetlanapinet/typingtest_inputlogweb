  <general_instructions>Welcome

In this session we will ask you to type letters, words and sentences that are shown on the screen.
Try to do this as fast and error free as possible.
If you make a mistake, it is not necessary to correct it. Typing mistakes are no problem. You can just continue typing. Correctness is less important than your typing speed.
